      <abstract>LANDFIREâ€™s (LF) Remap Canopy Base Height (CBH) supplies information used in fire behavior models to determine the critical point at which a surface fire will transition to a crown fire. CBH data are continuous from 0 to 9.9 meters (to the nearest 0.1 meter) and describe the lowest point in a stand where there is enough available fuel (0.25 in dia.) to propagate fire vertically through the canopy. Critical CBH is defined as the lowest point at which the canopy bulk density is .012 kg m-3. The CBH mapping process starts by deriving field referenced estimates of canopy characteristics through LF Reference Database (LFRDB) plot analysis. Utilizing LFRDB plots, a training data set to model CBH was created. Field referenced CBH values are calculated for each plot using the canopy fuel estimation software in Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS). Statistical analysis of plot variables indicates that LF Remap Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) and Existing Vegetation Height (EVH) demonstrate some influence on CBH, with Existing Vegetation Cover (EVC) affecting CBH values within certain EVTs. To model the relationsIAp LF Remap Canopy Cover (CC) and Canopy Height (CH) are used as predictors of CBH; developing a linear regression equation per EVT and disturbance type/severity. These CBH regression models account for roughly two-thirds of EVT assignments. To account for missing EVTs, regression equations from similar EVTs are utilized as surrogates ensuring consistent values throughout. 

In some, instances LF Remap assumes the potential burnable biomass in the tree canopy has been accounted for in the surface fuel model. For example, young or short conifer stands where the trees are represented by a shrub type fuel model will not have canopy characteristics. For tree stands dominated by broadleaf species that are fire resistant (e.g. Populus spp.) are coded with a CBH of 10 meters. the artificial increase in CBH is done to prevent false simulation of crown fires that rarely occur in these areas. All non-forest values, including herbaceous/shrub systems and non-burnable types (urban, barren, snow and ice, and agriculture) are coded as 0. However, certain types of agriculture and urban vegetation that are burnable are assigned a constant value by LF Remap Total Fuel Change Toolbar (LFTFC) rulesets based on region and vegetation type. 

LF Remap Annual Disturbance products are incorporated into CBH to provide informed changes by disturbance type, severity, and time since disturbance (TSD). Annual Disturbance products provide a pre-disturbance scenario represented by LF Remap existing vegetation products. The combination of pre-disturbance and non-disturbance vegetation are used to calculate CBH by vegetation type, cover, and height acted on by a disturbance event. Vegetation adjustments are modeled in disturbed areas based on disturbance type and severity using FVS derived linear equations. With the use of Annual Disturbance products, CBH also has capable fuels functionality. Capable fuels calculate TSD assignments for disturbed areas using an "effective year." For example, year 2020 fuels may be calculated for the year 2020. the new process considers all the existing disturbances included in LF Remap and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2020 in the example), making the products "2020 capable fuels." More information about capable fuels can be found at https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php. 

</abstract>
      <purpose>LF Remap is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions. LF Remap represents circa 2016 ground conditions and is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF Remap has improved past methodologies and processes to incorporate current satellite imagery, contemporary data sources, and the latest software and hardware technologies. Final LF Remap products offer significant improvements to all previous LF versions (read more about versions here https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php).

LF Remap products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. 

Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>This product has 2020 capable fuels functionality. Units are m * 10. To retrieve the real data value, user must divide the raster values in the data set by 10. The conversion from m to ft is 3.28 (multiply m by 3.28). CBH data range: 0 - 10 meters (0 - 100 raster values m*10). 100 = thematic class of all values greater than or equal to 10 meters and some stands dominated by broadleaf species. 

LF 2016 Remap Insular Areas (IA) were produced from the GMTED2010 data available on Earth Explorer (earthexplorer.usgs.gov). With the help of online shoreline data from (https://products.coastalscience.noaa.gov/collections/benthic/e99us_pac/) and online FAS_GIS_Mosaics (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/download/67475). During the production of the LF Remap IA products, shoreline data was buffered 3 Nautical Miles (American Samoa, Guam-Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Puerto Rico-U.S. Virgin Islands) and those extents were used.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Beginning in 2016 LF Remap products were created using recent advances in image compositing, tiling algorithms, and faster computing hardware to ensure that LF products remained relevant. LF Remap leveraged the Landsat archive, lidar data, and user contributed field plot data compiled into the LF Reference Database (LFRDB), to create new base map vegetation products. Reference resources included, but were not limited to, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program plot data (USFS https://fia.fs.fed.us/), Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent [(DSWE) USGS https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/], the National Land Cover Dataset [(NLCD) USGS https://www.mrlc.gov/data], and National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/].
