      <abstract>LANDFIREâ€™s (LF) Remap Anderson Fire Behavior Fuel Model 13 (FBFM13) product represents distinct distributions of fuel loadings found among surface fuel components (live and dead), size classes, and fuel types (Anderson 1982). The fuel models are described by the most common fire carrying fuel type (grass, brush, timber, or slash), loading and surface area-to-volume ratio by size class and component, fuel bed depth, and moisture of extinction. FBFM13 can be used for fire spread related characteristic models. 

LF Remap used vegetation products and 10-years of disturbance data to create Fuel Vegetation Type (FVT), Fuel Vegetation Cover (FVC), and Fuel Vegetation Height (FVH) for disturbed areas to represent pre-disturbance scenarios in FBFM13. A combination of pre-disturbance and non-disturbance Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) are used to assign surface fuel models. FBFM13 was developed using the most recent 10 years of Annual Disturbance products and is a capable fuels product that calculates Time Since Disturbance (TSD) assignments for disturbed areas using an "effective year." For example, year 2020 fuels may be calculated for the year 2020. the new process considers all the existing disturbances included in LF Remap and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2020 in the example), making the products "2020 capable fuels." More information about capable fuels can be found at https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php. </abstract>
      <purpose>LF Remap is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions. LF Remap represents circa 2016 ground conditions and is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF Remap has improved past methodologies and processes to incorporate current satellite imagery, contemporary data sources, and the latest software and hardware technologies. Final LF Remap products offer significant improvements to all previous LF versions (read more about versions here https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php).

LF Remap products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. 

Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>This product has 2020 capable fuels functionality. LF 2016 Remap Insular Areas (IA) were produced from the GMTED2010 data available on Earth Explorer (earthexplorer.usgs.gov). With the help of online shoreline data from (https://products.coastalscience.noaa.gov/collections/benthic/e99us_pac/) and online FAS_GIS_Mosaics (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/download/67475). During the production of the LF Remap IA products, shoreline data was buffered 3 Nautical Miles (American Samoa, Guam-Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Puerto Rico-U.S. Virgin Islands) and those extents were used.

        <procdesc>Beginning in 2016 LF Remap products were created using recent advances in image compositing, tiling algorithms, and faster computing hardware to ensure that LF products remained relevant. LF Remap leveraged the Landsat archive, lidar data, and user contributed field plot data compiled into the LF Reference Database (LFRDB), to create new base map vegetation products. Reference resources included, but were not limited to, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program plot data (USFS https://fia.fs.fed.us/), Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent [(DSWE) USGS https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/], the National Land Cover Dataset [(NLCD) USGS https://www.mrlc.gov/data], and National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/].
