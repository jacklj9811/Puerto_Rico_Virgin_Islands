      <abstract>LANDFIREâ€™s (LF) Remap Canopy Bulk Density (CBD) describes the mass of available canopy fuel per unit canopy volume that would burn in a crown fire. A spatially explicit map of CBD supplies information used in fire behavior models to determine the spread characteristics of crown fires across the landscape. The CBD mapping process derives field referenced estimates of canopy characteristics through LF Reference Database (LFRDB) plot analysis. Utilizing the LFRDB plots, field referenced CBD values are computed for each plot with the canopy fuel estimation software FuelCalc. In FuelCalc, for tree species that have no crown biomass, an equation for a species with a similar genus is used as a substitute. Species widely considered to be resistant to fire are excluded, for example, Acer and Populus spp. are excluded from the canopy fuel profile because these species are considered relatively inflammable and therefore unavailable. 

CBD has a series of post-processing techniques and logic checks ensuring it is relevant in the context of other fuel products and fire behavior predictions. All non-forest values and non-burnable types such as urban, barren, snow and ice, and agriculture are coded as 0. Some stands dominated by broadleaf species which typically do not permit initiation of crown fire (e.g. Populus spp.) are coded with a CBD of 0.01 kg m-3.  In some instances, LF Remap assumes the potential burnable biomass in the tree canopy has been accounted for in the surface fuel model. For example, young or short conifer stands where the trees are represented by a shrub type fuel model will not have canopy characteristics. 

LF Remap Annual Disturbance products are incorporated into CBD to provide informed changes by disturbance type, severity, and time since disturbance (TSD). Annual Disturbance products provide a pre-disturbance scenario represented by LF Remap existing vegetation products. Reporting of the pre-disturbance scenario helps to calculate CBD, with information about vegetation type, cover, and height impacted by a disturbance. With the use of Annual Disturbance products, CBD also has capable fuels functionality. Capable fuels calculate TSD assignments for disturbed areas using an "effective year." For example, year 2020 fuels may be calculated for the year 2020. the new process considers all the existing disturbances included in LF Remap and adjusts the TSD for these to the effective year (2020 in the example), making the products "2020 capable fuels." More information about capable fuels can be found at https://www.landfire.gov/lf_remap.php.

      <purpose>LF Remap is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions. LF Remap represents circa 2016 ground conditions and is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF Remap has improved past methodologies and processes to incorporate current satellite imagery, contemporary data sources, and the latest software and hardware technologies. Final LF Remap products offer significant improvements to all previous LF versions (read more about versions here https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php).

LF Remap products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. 

Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Managers and planners must evaluate LF products according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.
</purpose>
      <supplinf>This product has  2020 capable fuels functionality. Units are (kg/m^3 )*100 . To retrieve the real data value, user must divide the raster values in the data set by 100. The conversion from (kg/m^3 ) to (lb/ft^3 ) is 0.061728 (multiply (kg/m^3 ) by 0.061728). CBD Data Range: 0 - 0.45 (kg/m^3 ) (0 - 45 on the map) 0.45 = thematic class of all values greater than or equal to 0.45 meters 

LF 2016 Remap Insular Areas (IA) were produced from the GMTED2010 data available on Earth Explorer (earthexplorer.usgs.gov). With the help of online shoreline data from (https://products.coastalscience.noaa.gov/collections/benthic/e99us_pac/) and online FAS_GIS_Mosaics (https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/cgi-bin/OAS/prd/accession/download/67475). During the production of the LF Remap IA products, shoreline data was buffered 3 Nautical Miles (American Samoa, Guam-Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, and Puerto Rico-U.S. Virgin Islands) and those extents were used.</supplinf>

        <procdesc>Beginning in 2016 LF Remap products were created using recent advances in image compositing, tiling algorithms, and faster computing hardware to ensure that LF products remained relevant. LF Remap leveraged the Landsat archive, lidar data, and user contributed field plot data compiled into the LF Reference Database (LFRDB), to create new base map vegetation products. Reference resources included, but were not limited to, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program plot data (USFS https://fia.fs.fed.us/), Landsat Dynamic Surface Water Extent [(DSWE) USGS https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/], the National Land Cover Dataset [(NLCD) USGS https://www.mrlc.gov/data], and National Agricultural Statistics Service [(NASS) USDA - https://www.nass.usda.gov/].
